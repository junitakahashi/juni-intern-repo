## What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?
I already follow basic security measures such as using passwords on all my devices, avoiding suspicious links, and keeping my software updated. I also make sure to work in safe environments where no one else can access my screen.
However, I can improve by creating stronger, more unique passwords for each account and by consistently using a password manager. I will also make locking my devices a strict habit, even when stepping away for a short moment.

## How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?
I will integrate secure steps into my daily workflow. For example, I will lock my screen automatically whenever I stand up, enable auto-lock timers on all devices, and check twice before opening any unknown links or emails. By repeating these actions regularly, security becomes part of my routine instead of something I only think about after a risk appears.

## What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?
- Use a password manager to generate and store strong passwords
- Enable 2FA on all accounts whenever possible
- Avoid reusing passwords across platforms
- Regularly check for unusual login activity
- Update old or weak passwords immediately

## What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?
I would immediately change the affected account password and enable or confirm that 2FA is active. Then, I would report the issue to my supervisor or the team member at Focus Bear to receive instructions on how to appropriately secure the system. I would then finally reflect on what happened to avoid similar issues from happening again in the future.
