## How can you adjust your communication style to be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates?

I can adjust my communication style by being clear, direct, and structured. This includes breaking information into smaller steps, avoiding overly complex language, and providing examples or annotations when needed. I will also pay attention to my tone to ensure that messages feel supportive and non-judgmental, especially when someone expresses difficulty.

For teammates, I will allow extra processing time by not expecting immediate responses and by offering written summaries to reinforce clarity and memory. I will also avoid assuming others understand something right away, but instead, I will explain details clearly and provide additional context when helpful. This approach supports different communication and processing styles, making interactions more inclusive overall.

## What are some common UX or communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive?

- Text-heavy screens that overwhelm users with information
- Unclear button labels or hidden navigation
- Instructions that assume the user can complete multiple steps without reminders
- Notifications that create pressure or shame instead of gentle encouragement
- Visual clutter or inconsistent interface patterns that increase cognitive load
- Overstimulating use of colour 
- Error messages that blame the user instead of guiding them kindly

## What is one practical change you can make in your work to better support vulnerable populations?

One practical change I will make is to prioritise clarity and emotional sensitivity in all of my communication. When creating marketing materials, such as carousels, I will ensure the tone is calm, patient, and supportive, and that the message is delivered straightforwardly without overwhelming the user. I will also look for opportunities to simplify information and break it into digestible steps, making it easier for neurodivergent users to understand and act on. This reduces cognitive load and helps make the content more accessible and inclusive for all users.
