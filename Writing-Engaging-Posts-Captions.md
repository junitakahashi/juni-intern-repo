## **✏️ Writing Engaging Posts & Captions**

#### **📝 Reflection**

#### **Q. What are the key elements of a strong social media caption?**

1\. A clear hook

- Captures attention in the first 1–2 seconds  
- Calls out a relatable pain point, surprising fact, or emotional moment  
- Especially important for ADHD audiences who scroll quickly

Examples:  
“Struggling to start a ‘simple’ task?”  
“ADHD brain: 100 tabs open, zero tasks done.”

2\. Storytelling or relatable context

- Builds emotional connection  
- Normalises neurodivergent experiences  
- Helps followers feel understood rather than pressured

3\. Simplicity and clarity

- Short sentences  
- Line breaks  
- Avoiding overwhelming users with heavy text  
- Using direct language instead of complex explanations

4\. A supportive and non-judgmental tone

- Focus Bear users may face shame around productivity  
- Captions should feel gentle, validating, and low-pressure

5\. A call-to-action (CTA)

- Invites engagement without pressure:

“Which one do you relate to most?”  
“Save this for when task paralysis hits.”  
“Comment your tiny win today.”

**Q. How can Focus Bear’s tone and voice be consistent yet adaptable across platforms?**  
Focus Bear’s tone can remain consistent by always reflecting the same core qualities that are warm, empathetic, validating, and simple. No matter the platform, the voice should make neurodivergent users feel understood, supported, and never pressured. This consistency builds trust and emotional safety across all communication.  
By keeping the core tone the same but adjusting the format, length, and structure based on platform culture, Focus Bear can stay authentic while reaching each audience effectively.   
For example, on  
Instagram: Provide clear, digestible captions with line breaks and emojis. Educational, relatable, and aesthetic-friendly.  
TikTok: Very short, playful wording that complements the video. Quick hooks like “ADHD moment:” or “If you relate, you’re not alone.”  
Twitter/X: Snappy, conversational one-liners, relatable humor, and short reflections about ADHD life.

#### **🛠️ Task**

**Write three different post captions for a single topic, each using a different style.**

Topic: Task Initiation

Educational Style: 

| Struggling to start a “simple” task? That’s not laziness — it’s executive dysfunction. Try breaking your task into the *smallest possible* first step (like “open the laptop”). Small wins activate momentum. You don’t need a perfect start — just a gentle one. 💛 |
| :---- |

Humorous / Relatable Style

| My ADHD brain deciding TODAY is the perfect day to reorganize my entire room… *instead of starting the actual task I’ve been avoiding for 3 hours.* Yeah… we’ve all been there 😅 Starting is the hardest part — be kind to yourself. |
| :---- |

Motivational Style: 

| If starting feels impossible today, you’re not alone. Let’s start by choosing one tiny step (even 30 seconds counts\!) Big progress starts with these small beginnings 🌱 You’ve got this ✨ |
| :---- |

**Draft five ready-to-post captions based on Focus Bear’s content themes.**

| Morning Routines | If your morning routine feels overwhelming, try this: Pick one of your favorite habit. Just one\! Drink water. Stretch for 10 seconds. Open Focus Bear. Remember that tiny wins still countes, epecially on low-dopamine days 💛 |
| :---- | :---- |
| Executive Dysfunction | Your brain isn’t “broken” or “wierd.” It’s stuck in freeze mode, trying to protect you. Be gentle to yourself. Choose the smallest task possible 🌱 |
| ADHD Focus Struggles | Trying to focus with ADHD be like: 2% doing the task 98% fighting the urge to do literally anything else But that’s totally okay. Focus comes in waves. You can ride them, not force them✨ |
| Movements Breaks | Your body deserves a break too. Stand up, stretch your shoulders, roll your neck, take one deep breath. Your brain works better when your body is well rested. 🐻💛 |
| Low-Dopamine Days | If today feels heavier than usual, its’s okay be kind to yourself 💛 ✔ one small task ✔ one small kindness ✔ one small breath Low-dopamine days aren’t failures — they’re part of being human. |
