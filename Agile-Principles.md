## What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?

Benefits:

- Agile allows teams to adapt quickly when priorities or user needs change.
- Continuous feedback leads to better decisions and improved product quality.
- Breaking tasks into smaller pieces makes work less overwhelming and easier to track.
- Collaboration is stronger because communication happens frequently.

Challenges:

- Constant change can feel chaotic if not documented or communicated clearly.
- It requires discipline to keep tasks small and maintain transparency.
- For new team members, the lack of rigid structure can feel confusing at first.
- Miscommunication may lead to complicated issues in the team project. 

## How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?

Agile helps me stay organised by encouraging me to break down work into small, manageable tasks. It reminds me to communicate clearly, ask for feedback early, and avoid overthinking before starting. Agile also aligns with Focus Bear’s culture, working iteratively, trying things out, and improving based on results. This approach reduces pressure, supports learning, and helps me stay flexible when priorities shift.
