## What do you hope to learn from this internship?
I hope to gain new skills in digital marketing, particularly in understanding how campaigns are planned, executed, and evaluated from start to finish. I want to learn how to align marketing activities with the company’s mission, values, and user needs, and how to create campaigns that genuinely support those goals. I am also interested in learning the full process behind how product features are designed, researched, and tested, and how marketing contributes to those decisions. Overall, I want to build hands-on experience in a fast-paced environment where I can challenge myself, adapt quickly, and grow professionally.

## What skills are you most excited to develop?
I am excited to develop my skills in using various marketing tools and understanding how marketing works in a real startup environment. I’m especially interested in seeing how Focus Bear leverages digital tools to reach and support users.

I also want to improve my organisation and self-management by using the Focus Bear app myself, which will help me understand the product more deeply and communicate its value effectively to potential users.

## What do you think you can contribute to the team?
I believe I can contribute creative thinking and fresh ideas for marketing campaigns that may support user acquisition or brand awareness. I enjoy brainstorming, designing, and considering brand identity when developing concepts. I also bring a strong interest in wellbeing, routines, and user behaviour, which may help in shaping campaigns that resonate with Focus Bear’s target audience.

## What is one area you feel less confident in that you’d like to improve?
One area I’d like to improve is adapting quickly in fast-paced environments. Sometimes I struggle with completing tasks efficiently under time pressure, so I want to develop stronger time-management skills and become more confident in handling new challenges with speed and clarity.

## What does success in this internship look like for you?
Success for me would mean completing my assigned tasks to a high standard and contributing meaningfully to the team’s marketing efforts. It would also mean seeing positive outcomes from campaigns, whether in analytics, engagement, or learning. I also see success as being able to learn from mistakes, reflect on them, and continue improving so I can grow both personally and professionally throughout the internship.
