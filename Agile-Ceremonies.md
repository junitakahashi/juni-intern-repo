## How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?

Agile ceremonies create regular checkpoints where the team openly shares updates, challenges, and plans. During my internship at Focus Bear, stand-ups keep everyone aware of progress and blockers. It will also improve collaboration by addressing problems constructively and ensures the team always understands priorities.
These ceremonies prevent miscommunication, increase transparency, and keep everyone aligned even in remote or part-time environments like Focus Bear.

## Which ceremony is most important for your role, and why?

For my role, the Daily Stand-up is the most important. Since I work on marketing tasks that depend on understanding product priorities and understanding what needs to be addressed to the audience. Stand-ups help me stay aligned with what developers and the whole company is working on. It also gives me a chance to clarify uncertainties, share progress, and adjust my work based on team updates. Stand-ups also help me avoid working in isolation and ensure my content matches current feature development and timelines at an early stage.
