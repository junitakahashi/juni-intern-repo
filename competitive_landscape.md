For this task, I have evaluated a similar app that I have used before in the past, which is YPT (Yeolpumta) and Forest. 

## What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?
Focus Bear stands out because it is designed not just for focus sessions, but for full-day behavioural support, especially for people with ADHD or executive-function difficulties.

YPT focuses on tracking, study timers, progress graphs, rankings, and social groups, which enhance users’ motivation by evoking a willingness to aim higher rank or number.
Forest uses gamification (trees, coins, achievements) to keep you off your phone, which makes it useful for keeping motivation however, it requires a strong ability of self-control. 

Compared to these apps, Focus Bear focuses on guidance and behaviour change through morning/evening routines, movement breaks, micro-habits, and real distraction blocking across devices. It motivates users through structured reminders and neurodivergent-friendly design, which allows long-term habitual change in users’ lifestyles. 
It promotes:
- Guided routines
- Healthy habit prompts
- Cross-device app
- Website blocking
- AI content filtering


## If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?
I would choose Focus Bear if I want support beyond just timing or tracking my focus sessions.
This is because other apps like YPT only show your progress, but they don’t help you build routines or manage daily habits. Those apps tend to rely on willpower and motivation through gamification and ranking methods. 


On the other hand, Focus Bear provides step-by-step routines, regular breaks, and a dopamine-friendly design for better self-regulation. It offers AI-based distraction detection, which reduces the need to manually manage blocklists. These features of the app make it easier for anyone who struggles with impulse control or ADHD. So as a user, I would choose Focus Bear because it doesn’t just encourage focus but rather supports executive function, builds habits, and reduces the cognitive load of managing distractions.

## What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?
Social study groups and real-time rankings: In the YPT app, users can see how long others are studying, compare results, and motivate each other through competition. Focus Bear currently doesn’t include community or group accountability features.
Gamification with a visual reward system (trees, forests, coins, achievements): In the Forest app, users can plant new trees every time they complete a study session, where they can plant larger and prettier trees when they focus for longer hours. Gamification makes focus sessions feel enjoyable and playful, which can keep users returning consistently.

## Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?
Introduce optional:
- Soft gamification (badges, streak rewards, progress visuals)
- Shared focus rooms or optional study groups
- Weekly challenge goals with friends or teams

However, make sure that these elements are added in a non-overstimulating way, as it may be overwhelming for neurodivergent users. When done successfully, it would increase motivation and make focusing feel rewarding with these features.
