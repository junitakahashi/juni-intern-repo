## How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?

Kanban gives a clear visual overview of everything I’m working on, which helps me understand what truly needs attention. By limiting WIP, I avoid taking on too many tasks at the same time and prevent burnout. Seeing tasks laid out also helps me identify high-priority items and tackle them one at a time. I get tend to get overwhelmed by seeing too many things on my to-do list, so this method will help me reduce that stress during the internship, making work more manageable.

## How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?

I can improve my workflow by:
- Breaking tasks into smaller pieces so they move across the board more smoothly
- Moving cards immediately when status changes, keeping everything up to date
- Avoiding starting new tasks before finishing current ones
- Reviewing my board daily to stay aware of deadlines and workload
- Marking blocked tasks clearly so I can ask for help sooner
These habits help me stay organised, maintain clarity, and work more efficiently.
