## What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace?
- Laptop stands
- Comfortable chair that is adjustable to your height
- External keyboards and mouse

I can improve my setup by raising my laptop using a laptop stand so the screen is at eye level, and by using an external keyboard and mouse to keep my wrists in a neutral and comfortable position. Adjusting my chair height to ensure my feet are flat on the floor will also support better posture.

## What behavioural changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain?

- Keeping eye distance away from the monitor at all times
- Ensuring that my neck and back are kept straight 
- Standing up and stretching the body during breaks
- Drink water to keep hydrated

I can remind myself to sit upright with my back supported and avoid leaning forward toward the screen. I will take regular movement breaks, stretch my neck and shoulders throughout the day, and use eye-strain reduction techniques. I’ll also check my posture consistently to prevent slouching or tensing my shoulders.

## How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks?
- Set a movement habit on Focus Bear every one hour
- Set each focus mode for 1 hour and take a short break to move your body after each session.

I can use Focus Bear’s built-in movement reminders to schedule breaks every 60 minutes. I can also place a small note on my desk reminding me to check posture, or set recurring calendar alerts. This helps me build consistent habits without relying on memory alone.
