## What strategies work best to increase engagement and foster community?

Some effective strategies are: 
- Interactive content such as polls, check-ins, and Q&As helps reduce pressure on users by offering simple ways to participate without needing to write long responses.


- Personal stories that normalise ADHD struggles (e.g., executive dysfunction, task paralysis) help users feel understood and less alone. When people see experiences similar to their own, it creates emotional connection and reinforces that the Focus Bear community is a safe and relatable space.


- Community participation prompts like “What’s your win today?” or “Share your meltdown recovery tips” encourage users to interact not only with the brand but also with each other. This strengthens peer-to-peer connection and increases attachment to the Focus Bear community.


- User-generated content and reposts make followers feel seen, valued, and recognised. Featuring their stories or comments validates their experiences and increases trust and loyalty.


- Short, digestible carousels with clear takeaways ensure that content is accessible and does not overwhelm neurodivergent users. This helps avoid misunderstandings and keeps engagement high.


- Regular content series, such as “Monday Motivation” or “ADHD-Friendly Tips Thursday,” provide rhythm and predictability. This consistency is particularly supportive for neurodivergent audiences who benefit from structure and familiar patterns.

These strategies cultivate a sense of belonging and reduce the shame or loneliness many neurodivergent users experience.

## How can comment replies & DMs strengthen trust with neurodivergent audiences?

Comment replies and DMs build trust when they:
- Are empathetic, calm, and validating
- Avoid judgmental phrasing like “Just try harder”
- Provide clear, simple guidance without overwhelming details
- Celebrate small wins (“That’s awesome! Tiny progress still counts”)
- Normalize challenges (“A lot of us struggle with this—your experience is valid”)
- Maintain consistency in tone
- Respond promptly but without pressure

When users feel emotionally safe, they engage more and view Focus Bear as a supportive companion rather than a strict productivity tool.

## What tone and language feel authentic and inclusive for Focus Bear’s mission?

The ideal tone or Focus Bearis:
- Warm and friendly
- Supportive without pressure
- Clear and concise
- Neurodivergent-affirming
- Low-dopamine design (minimal overwhelm)
- Celebratory of small steps rather than perfection

For example use statement like: 
- “You’re doing your best”
- “small wins count”
- “No pressure”
- “Let’s make things a little easier together”
