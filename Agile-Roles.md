## What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?

My role is to deliver marketing campaigns, specifically by creating carousel content for Focus Bear’s social media platforms. To contribute effectively to the Agile process, I will break my work into small, manageable tasks such as content creation, research, competitive analysis, and social media planning. This allows me to deliver work iteratively and stay aligned with Agile principles of flexibility, transparency, and continuous improvement.

I will communicate frequently with the team, gather feedback early, and adjust my work based on shifting priorities. This ensures that each piece of content evolves through collaboration, stays aligned with the product direction, and delivers value in small, continuous increments.

## How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles?

My responsibilities overlap with other roles through close collaboration and clear communication. I regularly share updates so the team is aware of my progress, and I ask questions early to avoid misunderstandings or misalignment with product goals. My work requires creating content that accurately reflects the product experience, which means that I will be closely interacting with my supervisor for direction and visual consistency. 

I also support the team workflow by updating tasks that I will be working on, ensuring transparency and helping others understand what is in progress or ready for review. This consistent communication and coordination help maintain a smooth Agile process and keep everyone aligned.
