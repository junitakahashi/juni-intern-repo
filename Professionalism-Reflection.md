## Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism? What made it effective?
Yes. When I was working as a marketing intern at an inbound travel marketing agency, I experienced excellent teamwork and professionalism. Most communication took place on Slack, with occasional Google Meet check-ins. Team members responded promptly to each other, which kept the workflow smooth and transparent. What stood out most was the openness of the environment where people felt comfortable asking questions, raising concerns, and sharing ideas without hesitation. I also had fortnightly 1-on-1 meetings with my manager, which provided consistent feedback, recognition, and support. This transparency and psychological safety helped everyone stay aligned and motivated.

## What steps can you take to make sure your communication is clear, respectful, and inclusive?
- Preparing my thoughts in advance so I can communicate clearly and concisely
- Being honest and constructive when sharing opinions
- Listening actively to others and staying open to different ideas or perspectives
- Asking clarifying questions rather than making assumptions
- Showing appreciation and acknowledging others’ contributions
- Taking feedback positively and implementing improvements

## How can you help create a positive, fun, and professional work environment?
- Bringing enthusiasm and curiosity to my daily work
- Being eager to learn, ask questions, and share ideas
- Starting conversations with other interns and team members to build rapport
- Supporting teammates and celebrating small wins
- Maintaining a friendly, respectful tone in all communication
- Helping create an environment where everyone feels safe to speak up

## How can you prepare effectively for meetings with supervisors and colleagues?
- Completing all assigned tasks beforehand
- Listing any questions or discussion points I want to raise

- Coming prepared with solution-oriented suggestions when possible

## What would it look like to be proactive during your internship?
- Asking thoughtful questions instead of waiting to be told what to do
- Offering ideas and sharing opinions confidently
- Giving colleagues feedback or appreciation when appropriate
- Taking initiative on tasks and putting in high effort
- Requesting feedback regularly and showing improvements over time
- Identifying problems early and proposing potential solutions

## How might you follow up with colleagues or supervisors if you need information/action from them? How would you escalate it further if you don't get a response, and when would you escalate?
- Following up politely through Discord with a clear, concise message
- Bringing up the question during weekly stand-up meetings, if needed
- If I receive no response after a reasonable amount of time, I will send one more polite follow-up
- If there is still no response, raise the issue with Jeremy so it can be addressed appropriately

## What are some things you won't do?
- Disrespect or speak negatively toward colleagues
- Keep concerns to myself if they affect work or team well-being

- Fail to update the supervisors about my progress
