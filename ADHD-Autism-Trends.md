## What types of content resonate most with ADHD and Autism communities?

The content that resonates most tends to be:

- Relatable contents that highlight shared struggles like losing motivation, task paralysis, sensory overwhelm, inability to start “easy” tasks.
- Validating and emotionally safe posts that say things that they struggle are normal, “This is normal” rather than pushing productivity pressure.
- Short and digestible content so that it does not affect user’s attention challenges and cognitive load.
- Clear visuals using simple layouts, clean text, minimal clutter.
- Showcasing authentic and real content as people love seeing lived experiences instead of overly polished messaging.
- Adding humorous aspects to some extent helps reduce shame around symptoms.

In short, neurodivergent audiences engage most with content that is relatable, gentle, and easy to consume.
