## What are the key elements of a strong social media caption?
#### A clear hook
- Captures attention in the first 1–2 seconds
- Calls out a relatable pain point, surprising fact, or emotional moment
- Especially important for ADHD audiences who scroll quickly
- Examples:
“Struggling to start a ‘simple’ task?”
“ADHD brain: 100 tabs open, zero tasks done.”

#### Storytelling or relatable context
- Builds emotional connection
- Normalises neurodivergent experiences
- Helps followers feel understood rather than pressured

#### Simplicity and clarity
- Short sentences
- Line breaks
- Avoiding overwhelming users with heavy text
- Using direct language instead of complex explanations

#### A supportive and non-judgmental tone
- Focus Bear users may face shame around productivity
- Captions should feel gentle, validating, and low-pressure

#### A call-to-action (CTA)
- Invites engagement without pressure:
- Examples:
“Which one do you relate to most?”
“Save this for when task paralysis hits.”
“Comment your tiny win today.”

## How can Focus Bear’s tone and voice be consistent yet adaptable across platforms?
Focus Bear’s tone can remain consistent by always reflecting the same core qualities that are warm, empathetic, validating, and simple. No matter the platform, the voice should make neurodivergent users feel understood, supported, and never pressured. This consistency builds trust and emotional safety across all communication.
By keeping the core tone the same but adjusting the format, length, and structure based on platform culture, Focus Bear can stay authentic while reaching each audience effectively. 

For example, on
- Instagram: Provide clear, digestible captions with line breaks and emojis. Educational, relatable, and aesthetic-friendly.
- TikTok: Very short, playful wording that complements the video. Quick hooks like “ADHD moment:” or “If you relate, you’re not alone.”
- Twitter/X: Snappy, conversational one-liners, relatable humor, and short reflections about ADHD life.
