## When should you use AI for assistance, and when should you rely on your own skills?
I should use AI when I need support with brainstorming ideas, improving the clarity and structure of my writing, or understanding technical instructions. AI is also helpful for saving time on routine tasks such as drafting templates, summarising content, or generating initial versions of documents that I can later refine.

However, I should rely on my own skills when making decisions, analysing data, applying company policies, or producing any work that involves confidential information or personal judgment. As a marketing strategy intern, my role requires critical and creative thinking that AI cannot replace. Developing an effective strategy involves understanding the current situation at Focus Bear, experimenting with new ideas, and crafting messages that align with the company’s themes and goals. This type of work requires consistency, contextual understanding, and originality, areas where AI can be helpful but not fully trusted or depended on. Therefore, AI should assist my thinking, not substitute it.

## How can you avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?
I can avoid over-reliance on AI by making sure I think through ideas on my own before asking for assistance. I will start by brainstorming independently and forming my own understanding of the task. When I do use AI, it will only be as a support tool, for example, to suggest possible approaches or provide clarity and not to make decisions for me. This means I will always review, edit, and rewrite the output in my own words, ensuring it is accurate and appropriate for the specific context at Focus Bear. By combining AI’s speed with my own judgement and creativity, I can maintain ownership of my work, strengthen my skills, and continue learning without becoming dependent on AI.

## What steps will you take to ensure data privacy when using AI tools?
I will make sure to 
- never paste private Focus Bear information into AI tools
- remove any sensitive details before asking for help
- double-check whether a task is safe to use with AI before proceeding
- ask my supervisor for clarification if anything is unsure
