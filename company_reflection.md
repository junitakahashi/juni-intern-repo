## Why do you think Focus Bear was created?

I believe Focus Bear was created to help people stay focused on a single task without getting pulled away by constant digital distractions. More people, especially students and young adults, struggle to stay concentrated and complete tasks, and Focus Bear provides practical tools across both laptop and mobile to block unrelated websites and apps. This allows users to stay aligned with what they committed to do. It is also designed to be friendly for neurodivergent users who may experience greater challenges with executive functioning and want support in building healthier routines.

## What problem is Focus Bear solving?

- Difficulty focusing on one task and being easily distracted, especially for neurodivergent users
- Struggling to build or maintain healthy habits
- Feeling stuck in cycles of unproductive or unhealthy routines

## Why do you think this mission is important?

This mission is important because many people want to improve their focus and lifestyle, but lack the right support systems. While there are many focus timers and blocking apps available, most of them offer generic features. Focus Bear differentiates itself by deeply understanding the challenges faced by neurodivergent individuals and designing functions tailored to their needs. Supporting this community has real social value, because by being able to focus better, having sustainable routines, and well-being can significantly improve both academic and personal outcomes.

## How does Focus Bear’s work align with your personal values or interests?

Focus Bear’s mission aligns with my values because I care about improving people’s lives and creating a society where individuals with diverse needs feel supported rather than left behind. I’ve also always been interested in wellbeing, and I try to prioritise my own mental and physical health through activities like yoga, walking, running, and baking. These routines help me manage stress and stay grounded.

I also consider myself a structured person. I like planning ahead and staying organised so I don’t fall behind. However, I still experience moments where my focus slips or I struggle to control distractions. Focus Bear’s approach to building helpful routines and reducing digital overwhelm genuinely aligns with my needs and the kind of support I value in my daily life.

## Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?

I do relate to several of the challenges that Focus Bear addresses. As a busy student juggling university, work, and personal commitments, I sometimes struggle to stay focused on one task without getting distracted by my phone or laptop. Even when I plan my day carefully, it can be difficult to follow through, especially when stress or fatigue makes it harder to stay disciplined. I tend to feel stressed during the semester when I am overwhelmed by the amount of tasks I have to complete by a certain date. 

I also find that maintaining healthy habits can be inconsistent. Although I try to take care of my well-being, there are periods when routines slip, or I default to less productive patterns. Focus Bear’s tools for reducing digital distractions and supporting habit consistency offer the type of structure and guidance that would help me stay accountable and maintain the lifestyle I strive for.
