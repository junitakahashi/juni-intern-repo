## What steps can you take to ensure you handle data securely in your daily tasks?

- Avoid downloading or storing user data locally unless it is strictly necessary.
- Keep my laptop and accounts protected with strong passwords and two-factor authentication.
- Double-check before copying any content into external tools or documents to ensure it does not contain identifiable user information.
- Use anonymised examples when discussing user behaviour (e.g. “a user with ADHD” instead of names or specific details).
- Log out or lock my device whenever I am away from my desk.

## How should you store, share, and dispose of sensitive information safely?

I will only store in approved systems in Focus Bear such as official dashboards, secure cloud tools used by Focus Bear and not on personal USBs, screenshots folder, or random notes.

I will only share sensitive information using secure channels through university email that directly reaches to my supervisor and also avoid open or public spaces when I’m in an online meeting. If I need to share logs or screenshots, I will blur or remove any identifiable data.

I will dispose files securely when they are no longer needed and avoid leaving copies in trash folders, downloads, or personal cloud storage. If information is anonymised or aggregated, I will make sure it cannot be traced back to a single user.

## What are some common mistakes that lead to data privacy issues, and how can they be avoided?

- Copying real user data into external tools (e.g. AI tools, personal docs, chat apps) without anonymising it.
- Using weak or reused passwords, which can lead to account compromise.
- Leaving devices unlocked which it allows others to see sensitive information.
- Unintentionally sharing private information such as email addresses or names in screenshots.
- Not reporting small mistakes immediately to the supervisor, which can turn into bigger problems later.

To avoid these mistakes, I will make sure to do the following:
- Building the habit of anonymising by default.
- Using a password manager and enabling 2FA.
- Locking devices by default when stepping away.
- Carefully checking screenshots or examples before sharing.
- Reporting any mistake or suspicion early instead of ignoring it.
